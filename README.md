==================

modular split-flap units

splitting the flap is a modular split flap display system based on Arduino. Split flap displays were invented by Solari di Udine in the 60's and used in several train stations and airports around the world. Now out of production and on the path to extinction, I have tried to be as close as possible to the original iconic design.

Project is currently at prototyping stage and files are under constant development - use at your own risk.
